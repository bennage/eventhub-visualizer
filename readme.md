# Partition Visualizer for Azure Event Hubs

This is a hacked together WPF application that makes it a little easier to see how events are following through an [Event Hub][].

You'll need to copy the config template (`EventHubMonitor.Template.config`) and rename it to `EventHubMonitor.config`, and
supply the appropriate values.
